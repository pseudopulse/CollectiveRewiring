# Collective Rewiring
A collection of tweaks to content added by Alloyed Collective. Everything is configurable.

## Operator Changes
- Healing Drone, DOC, Barrier Drone, Emergency Drone, and CHIRP can now be cast on allies (excluding other drones)
- DOC barrier increased to 40% and buff duration increased to 8s
- Gunner Drone (not CROSSHAIRS) damage per bullet increased to 125%
- Drone Secondaries now have an internal cooldown equal to your Secondary cooldown (you will never cycle to a cooldown drone unless it is your only option)
- Allows forcing a drone you are looking at to the front of the queue, and queues every duplicate copy of that drone in sequence afterward. Triggered via a customizable keybind.
- Emergency Drone heal range reduced to 18m, but can be sent directly to an ally's position
- Command no longer empties all stocks in half a second if M2 is held.
- Improves Drone Queue UI
- Adds extra SFX to OCR's kill ricochet.
- Increases the max damage of OCR to 1000%

## Wandering CHEF
- Now appears on Commencement, Prime Meridian, and Void Locus (only if the DLC is enabled)

## Solus Heart
- Rejecting the offering can now only be done with skill damage and only from players who are close by.
