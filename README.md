# Collective Rewiring
A collection of tweaks to content added by Alloyed Collective. Everything is configurable.

## Operator Changes
- Healing Drone, DOC, Barrier Drone, Emergency Drone, and CHIRP can now be cast on allies (excluding other drones)
- DOC barrier increased to 40% and buff duration increased to 8s
- Gunner Drone (not CROSSHAIRS) damage per bullet increased to 125%
- Drone Secondaries now have an internal cooldown equal to your Secondary cooldown (you will never cycle to a cooldown drone unless it is your only option)
- Allows forcing a drone you are looking at to the front of the queue, and queues every duplicate copy of that drone in sequence afterward. Triggered via a customizable keybind.
- Emergency Drone heal range reduced to 18m, but can be sent directly to an ally's position.
- Command no longer empties all stocks in half a second if M2 is held.
- Improves Drone Queue UI.
- Adds extra SFX to OCR's kill ricochet.
- Increases the max damage of OCR to 1000%
- Reduces the damage of Nano-Bugged to +50%.
- Operator's 2 starting drones now inherit (most) items.

## Wandering CHEF
- Now appears on Commencement, Prime Meridian, and Void Locus (only if the DLC is enabled)

## Solus Heart
- Rejecting the offering can now only be done with skill damage and only from players who are close by.

## SPEX
- Same damage requirements as downed Solus Heart.

## Crafting
- Restores the recipes for elite aspects that got removed in the AC bugfix patch, with some modifications to fix DLC aspects being craftable from base-game items.

## Neutronium Weight
- Guaranteed to return to you. No longer drops onto the floor.
- Passing the weight now deals 100% (+50% per stack) TOTAL damage, inheriting the properties of the triggering attack and inflicting Cripple.
- The weight can no longer be passed to non-player allies and the weight will return to its proper owner both on kill (regardless of killer) and at the end of the stage.
